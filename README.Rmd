# Analysis of Impact of Red Card Recipient's Poisiton on Match Outcome

## Safia Read and Ben Schwartz

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
*The purpose of this project is to invsestigate whether the position a player is when they are recieving a red card has an impact on the outcome of the match. This is important because match outcome has several economic effects (sponsership, gambling, etc.) that makes winning a much more desirable outcome than losing. Knowing more about how red cards affect match outcome and also a team's offensive and defensive capabilities can help teams to strategize and betting sites to better formulate their live odds.
